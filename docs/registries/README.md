# GSD Registries: Community Capability Registry & EoS Registry

Specification, entry schema, and submission process for GSD's two third-party discoverability catalogs — the **GSD Community Capability Registry** and the **GSD EoS Registry**.

---

## Non-endorsement stance

> Inclusion in this registry means only that a maintainer merged a PR that linked to the author's repository. It is not an endorsement. GSD has not reviewed, tested, audited, or verified the correctness, quality, safety, or security of any listed solution, nor its claimed GSD interactions. Use at your own risk; evaluate the linked source yourself. Entries are removed only for illegal content, malware, spam, or a link that is dead/completely non-functional — never curated for quality.

This stance applies identically to every entry in both registries. It is reproduced verbatim at the top of each generated catalog (`capability-registry.md`, `eos-registry.md`).

## Narrow removal policy

A merged entry is removed **only** for one of these reasons:

- The linked content is illegal.
- The linked repository distributes malware.
- The entry is spam (not a genuine, working solution).
- The linked repository or its default branch is dead or completely non-functional (404, archived-and-empty, permanently inaccessible).

A registry entry is **never** removed for quality, staleness of a working project, disagreement with its design, or because a maintainer would have built it differently. The registry is a directory, not a curated marketplace — see [Non-endorsement stance](#non-endorsement-stance) above.

---

## What gets listed

Two independent catalogs, sharing one schema shape, one non-endorsement stance, and one submission process:

- **Community Capability Registry** (`docs/registries/capability-registry.md`, generated from `docs/registries/capabilities.json`) — third-party **Feature Capabilities**: plug-ins that attach at GSD's Loop Extension Points (ADR-857, ADR-894, ADR-1244) and are installed with `gsd capability install <spec>`.
- **EoS Registry** (`docs/registries/eos-registry.md`, generated from `docs/registries/eos.json`) — third-party **Embeddable Orchestration System (EoS)** host integrations: projects that embed GSD as an orchestration engine inside a host through the ADR-1239 Host-Integration Interface.

Both registries are non-endorsing discoverability catalogs (issue #2182). Neither is the runtime **Capability Registry** (the generated manifest consumed at load time, ADR-894 §5) or the **Capability Registry Overlay** (the runtime loader that merges an installed third-party manifest into that generated registry, ADR-1244 D2) — see `CONTEXT.md` → "Community Capability Registry" and "EoS Registry" for the full disambiguation.

## Entry schema

Every entry is one JSON object in `docs/registries/capabilities.json` or `docs/registries/eos.json`, validated by `scripts/registry-schema.cjs`. Field names below are exact and case-sensitive; unknown top-level keys are rejected.

### Capability entries (`capabilities.json`, `type: "capability"`)

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | Unique slug across the registry (`^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`). |
| `name` | yes | Human-readable name. |
| `type` | yes | Must equal `"capability"`. |
| `repo` | yes | `owner/repo` on github.com — the author's own repository. |
| `description` | yes | One-paragraph plain-language description of the solution and the problem it solves. |
| `author` | yes | Author name (and, optionally, contact). |
| `license` | yes | SPDX identifier (or `UNLICENSED` / `Proprietary`). |
| `enginesGsd` | yes | Declared `engines.gsd` semver range (ADR-1244 D1), e.g. `>=1.6.0`. |
| `install` | yes | Exact, copy-pasteable install command — the ADR-1244 URL-import flow, e.g. `gsd capability install https://github.com/OWNER/REPO.git#v1.0.0`. |
| `uninstall` | yes | Exact, copy-pasteable removal command, e.g. `gsd capability remove <id>`. |
| `interactions` | yes | Object — see below. |
| `discussion` | yes | URL of this entry's GitHub Discussion (`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/discussions/<n>`). |

`interactions` (Capability):

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `loopExtensionPoints` | yes, non-empty | Subset of the 12 Loop Extension Points the capability registers on: `discuss:pre`, `discuss:post`, `plan:pre`, `plan:post`, `execute:pre`, `execute:wave:pre`, `execute:wave:post`, `execute:post`, `verify:pre`, `verify:post`, `ship:pre`, `ship:post`. |
| `hookKinds` | yes | Subset of `step`, `contribution`, `gate` — the hook kind registered at each point above. |
| `configKeys` | yes | Array of federated config keys the capability owns (may be empty). |
| `requires` | yes | Array of other Capability ids this capability depends on (may be empty). |
| `runtimeCompat` | yes | Array of compatible runtimes; `["all"]` is allowed. |
| `produces` | yes | Array describing artifacts/data the capability produces (may be empty). |
| `consumes` | yes | Array describing artifacts/data the capability consumes (may be empty). |

| `profile` | yes | One of the three host-capability profiles: `programmatic-cli`, `declarative-cli`, `ide`. |
| `axes` | yes | Object with **exactly** the eight ADR-1239 negotiated axes keys: `embeddingMode`, `commandSurface`, `dispatch`, `modelMode`, `hookBus`, `stateIO`, `transport`, `runtime`. |

`axes` value vocabulary:

|---|---|
| `embeddingMode` | `imperative`, `declarative` |
| `commandSurface` | `slash-file`, `slash-programmatic`, `slash-toml`, `palette`, `prose-only` |

## Submission process

Registration is a **documentation PR**, per [CONTRIBUTING.md → Documentation Updates](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#documentation-updates--update-the-relevant-docs):

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Edit** `docs/registries/capabilities.json` (Capability Registry) or `docs/registries/eos.json` (EoS Registry) and append exactly one entry matching the [schema](#entry-schema) above.
3. **Run `npm run gen:registry`** to regenerate the corresponding `docs/registries/capability-registry.md` or `docs/registries/eos-registry.md`. Commit both the JSON source and the regenerated markdown.
4. **Open a PR** from a `docs/<issue#>-<slug>` branch (see CONTRIBUTING.md branch-naming conventions) using the [registry-entry PR template](../../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/registry-entry.md).
5. A maintainer reviews and merges. The only gate is whether the entry is a real, linkable solution with all required fields present — not a quality judgment (see [Non-endorsement stance](#non-endorsement-stance)).

**One entry = one PR.** Do not bundle multiple registry additions, updates, or removals into a single PR.

**The generated `.md` files are GENERATED — never hand-edit them.** `docs/registries/capability-registry.md` and `docs/registries/eos-registry.md` are produced by `scripts/gen-registry.cjs` from `capabilities.json` / `eos.json`. A PR that edits the generated markdown without a matching JSON source change will fail the `gen:registry --check` drift gate. Always edit the JSON and regenerate.

---

## Latest-release tracking

Each entry embeds a live [shields.io](https://shields.io) badge and a permalink to the linked repository's latest GitHub Release:

```
![release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/OWNER/REPO?sort=semver&include_prereleases)
```

```
https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/releases/latest
```

There is no re-registration on new releases: register once, and your GitHub Releases are the update channel forever. The badge and permalink are rendered live by GitHub's markdown viewer directly from the linked repository — the registry itself never needs a follow-up PR when you cut a new version.

---

## Ranking + comments

Ranking and community feedback live in **GitHub Discussions**, not in the registry markdown. Each merged entry gets exactly one Discussion in a dedicated `Registry` Discussions category:

- **Upvotes** on the Discussion post and on individual comments, with GitHub's built-in **Top** sort surfacing the most-upvoted community feedback first.
- **Threaded comments** for experience reports, questions, and follow-up from other users.

**Operational setup (one-time, per repo):** a repo admin creates the `Registry` category under this repository's Discussions settings. From then on, every merged entry gets its own Discussion thread created in that category, and the thread's URL is recorded in the entry's `discussion` field (see [Entry schema](#entry-schema) above) so the generated catalog links directly to it.
