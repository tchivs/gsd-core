/**
 * #2138 — track_shipping ship-note must be pushed onto the PR branch.
 *
 * ship.md's track_shipping step committed the STATE ship-note (Phase N shipped —
 * PR #N) AFTER create_pr and never pushed it. The commit stayed local-only, so
 * when the GitHub PR merged (especially fast/auto-merge) the ship-note was not in
 * the source branch and never reached the default branch — STATE's ship-status
 * was silently lost.
 *
 * The fix pushes the ship-note commit onto the PR branch with a `[ci skip]`
 * trailer (honored by GitHub) so it lands on merge without triggering a redundant
 * pipeline. This test is a source-text regression guard: ship.md IS the product
 * the runtime loads, so asserting its track_shipping step pushes (with [ci skip])
 * guards the deployed contract.
