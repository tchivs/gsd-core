/**
 * Regression test for #2198 — advertised base64/entropy/homoglyph scanning
 * never runs live. `scanEntropyAnomalies` + `shannonEntropy` were dead exports
 * (zero callers outside their own unit tests). The live hooks inline their
 * own pattern subsets "for hook independence" and never call these functions.
 *
 * This test asserts the chosen contract: the dead export was removed and the
 * docs no longer over-claim entropy analysis as a live MUST.
 *
 * Contract: `scanForInjection` is retained — it serves as the CI codebase
 * scanner engine (tests/prompt-injection-scan.security.test.cjs). It is NOT
 * called from live hooks; hooks inline their own patterns.
